To get an input on the hardware board, we have GPIO (general purpose input output) pins. 

These GPIO pins can be configured as 4 types 
1. Digital input
2. Digital output
3. Analog input(ADC)/ Output(DAC)
4. Alternate function (USART)

By default all peripherals are not clocked. we need to enable the clock to each peripheral we
wish to use. (Provide CLOCK to the port)

Configure the desired I/O as OUTPUT or INPUT in the GPIOx_MODER register.

The features of the GPIO:
Interrupt generation : we can configure each bit of the I/O pins to generate interrupts. 
After an interrupt is triggered, the corresponding bit in the INTSTATUS Register is set. 
This also causes the corresponding bit of the GPIOINT[15:0] signal to be asserted. 
As a result, the combined interrupt signal, COMBINT, is also asserted. 
we can clear the interrupt status using an interrupt handler that writes 1 to the corresponding bit of the INTCLEAR Register, the same address as the INTSTATUS Register.
